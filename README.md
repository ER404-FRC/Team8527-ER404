FRC Team CAD, code, and website

## About

We are a first-time FRC team hoping to learn the ropes of the new competition. However, many of us participated in FLL, so we hope that this will give us some sort of prior experience.

### Website
We are hosting our website on Arch Linux server running Apache. To learn more, please visit apache.org and archlinux.org.

Our website consists of 3 pages: a home page, about page, and donate page. We want poeple to know more about what we do, and we hope that they support our team.

Currently, the languages we are using for our website are:
